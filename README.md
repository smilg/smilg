#### About me
I'm an electrical engineer at [Mesodyne](https://mesodyne.com/). I graduated with my B.S. in electrical and computer engineering from [Olin College of Engineering](https://www.olin.edu) in 2024. I'm passionate about making hardware and things that are cool. If you want to see some projects I've done, check out [my portfolio website 🌐](https://smilg.dev) (I made it myself from scratch! ... WIP). If you want to get in touch, feel free to send me an email at [milly@smilg.dev](mailto:milly@smilg.dev).
